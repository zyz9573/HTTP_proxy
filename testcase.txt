INPORTANT: this file will guide you test this proxy, some case will offer bash file for you to test, others are not
Sorry we are not familiar with writting bash file.

VERY FIRST: set your browser with proxy and run proxy by type sudo docker-compose up

1.1 GET
go to http://people.duke.edu/~tkb13/courses/ece650/
you can also test GET method by run offered bash file

1.2 POST
go to http://www.csm-testcenter.org/test?do=show&subdo=common&test=file_upload
then upload some file, if success, this website will show you upload file successfully or let you download your uploaded file

1.3 Connect
go to Google and search thing

2.1 cache the response
run 
echo -e "GET http://people.duke.edu/~tkb13/courses/ece650/resources/awesome.txt HTTP/1.1\r\nHost: people.duke.edu\r\nCache-Control: no-cache, no-store\r\n\r\n" | nc $HOSTNAME 12345
you will see not cacheable because request say no cache and no store in proxy.log
run
echo -e "GET http://people.duke.edu/~tkb13/courses/ece650/resources/awesome.txt HTTP/1.1\r\nHost: people.duke.edu\r\n\r\n" | nc $HOSTNAME 12345
you will see cached in proxy.log

2.2 rules of expiration time
go to http://cdn.optimizely.com/js/310987714.js and fresh this website
if you use some tools like wireshark or HTTP HEADER VIEWER you will see the response this website give back have Cache-Control: max-age=120 so if you wait 2 min and then refresh you will see 304 Not Modified in proxy.log, it is part of expiration rule. If the response have Expires key and current time is larger than its value, this proxy will request original server to give response even it has it in cache

2.3 rules of must revalidation
run the bash file and I have write 
echo -e "GET http://people.duke.edu/~tkb13/courses/ece650/resources/awesome.txt HTTP/1.1\r\nHost: people.duke.edu\r\nCache-Control: must-revalidate\r\n\r\n" | nc $1 12345 &
many times. 
So the file will be stored in cache but every time it need to revalidate, so the proxy will send it to original server and because this file don't chage so you will see 304 Not Modified in proxy.log

EXTRAï¼š
You can just run the bash and see some straightfoward result but you also can just go to some huge website and use search tool to find some specified word in proxy.log and you will find what you want.
