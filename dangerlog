6Your code should be robust to external failures
we used try catch structure to deal with exception, for every thread. we use this in parse_request_line function, add_kv function amd parse_response_line function for we used standard format to parse it but it will be some malformed request and response so we need to handle it. you can see it in proxy.log if such circumstance happens. We will record it and release all resources, close socket then return, end this thread.
